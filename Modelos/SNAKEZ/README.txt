# Summary

Snakez are a super bendy flexible fun print-in-place design. They should be ready to wriggle straight off the build plate (as soon as the raft is removed). No support required and they don't use much filament. 

People can't believe he range of movement in these prints. Snakez can be twisted and turned in all directions... even curled up in the palm of your hand. This one piece print will amaze people at what you can do with a 3D printer and clever design. 

In addition to being super bendy and flexible Snakez also feature retracting fangs. They move back and forth in a channel but will not fall out.

But most of all Snakez are fun...

Five .stl's have been provided. One is straight (approx. 177mm long). The other has each section curved to help it fit on smaller build plates (134mm long). The third is a Key Fob version that has been shortened by 5 links (118mm long). This makes it more practical / usable as the reduced length helps avoid it getting tangled on other things and / or broken. The fourth is the 'Long Snakez' file which is approximately double the standard Snakez length so a 'long 350mm. The print length is just 144mm as it is curved quite tightly... this should print okay on most well set up / precise machines and users of good slicing apps but it may result in fused joints on some machines.  

The last option is the 'Circle Tight' version which is made to print on very small build plates. The length is he same as the regular 'Snakez' file but the file is curved to a greater degree to form a half circle and minimise the print area required. However, that also means clearances have been slightly reduced which could cause issues on less precise/accurate machines. This has been test printed and worked fine. 

Print lots of Snakez in you favourite colors. Fun little creatures to place around your house, office, workshop or even in your car.  

Snakez make great little gifts as well. They don't use much filament but the print time is longer than many other small prints due to the detail in the linkages etc. 

Snakez are an easy print. Raft is recommended but do not use support as this could fuse linkages so they won't move after printing  Using 3 shells and 50% infill is also suggested to ensure the fine linkages are strong and will withstand a life of being wriggled.  

Print lots... have fun with your Snakez and post images!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerBot
Printer: MakerBot Replicator (5th Generation)
Rafts: Yes
Supports: No
Resolution: Standard / 0.20mm in PLA
Infill: 50% with 3 shells to make the fine linkages strong

Notes: 
Recommend using Raft for easy and safe removal from the build plate. Do not use support as this could stop the model from moving after printing. 

Suggest using 3 shells and 50% infill to ensure the linkage is strong so your Snakez won't break easily. 

Choose the right file... two .stl's have been provided. One is straight (approx. 174mm long). The other has each section curved to help it fit on smaller build plates (134mm long).  .
